Special Features: No electrical motor - non sparking.\nNo mechanical seals or gland packing.\nThe pumps can run dry indefinitely without damage.\nSafe for use in hazardous / explosive environments.\nVariable flow - simply regulate the inlet air supply to adjust the pump flow from zero to max.\nIf discharge is clogged or closed pump stops i",

    "description": "An End Suction Pump is a type of centrifugal pump where the liquid enters the pump from one end (the suction side) and exits from the top or the discharge side of the pump casing. This design is one of the most common and widely used types of pumps in various industries, especially for handling clean or mildly contaminated fluids. These pumps are typically used for water transfer, HVAC systems, irrigation, and other industrial applications.",

The compressed air is shifted from one chamber to the other by a linked shaft that allows the chambers to move simultaneously. This back-and-forth motion forces liquid out of one chamber and into the discharge piping while the other chamber is being filled with liquid at the same time. These pumps use reciprocating elastomeric diaphragms and check valves to pump fluid. The liquid chambers are filled and emptied by fluid that is drawn through a common inlet and discharged through a single outlet. Special Features: No electrical motor - non sparking.\nNo mechanical seals or gland packing.\nThe pumps can run dry indefinitely without damage.\nSafe for use in hazardous / explosive environments.\nVariable flow - simply regulate the inlet air supply to adjust the pump flow from zero to max.\nIf discharge is clogged or closed pump stops i",
